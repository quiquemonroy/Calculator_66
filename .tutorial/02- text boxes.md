# Adding Text
## Let's Talk About Text Baby

We can add text boxes to our windows using the entirely obvious `text` command.

ðŸ‘‰ Here's the code you need in isolation:
```python

text = tk.Text(window ,height=1, width = 50)
# Three arguments, name of the window to place the text box in, height & width.
text.pack

```

ðŸ‘‰ And here it is in context.

```python
window = tk.Tk()
window.title("Hello World") 
window.geometry("300x300") 

label = 0

def updateLabel():
  global label
  label += 1 
  hello["text"] = label 
  

hello = tk.Label(text = label) 
hello.pack() 

button = tk.Button(text = "Click me!", command = updateLabel) 
button.pack()

text = tk.Text(window ,height=1, width = 50)
text.pack

tk.mainloop()
```
This gives us a window with a text box like this:
![](resources/02_textBox1.png)

## It All Adds Up

Let's make our program add the number in the text box to the number in the label when the button is pressed.

ðŸ‘‰ To do this, we need to change the `updateLabel` subroutine.  Here's the code in isolation:
```python
def updateLabel():
  global label
  number = text.get("1.0","end") # Gets the number from the text box (starting at the first position and going to the end.) and stores in the number variable
  number = int(number) #Casts to an integer. I've done this on a separate line to prevent the line above getting too complex, but you can combine the two.
  label += number # Adds the number from the text box to the one in the label.
  hello["text"] = label 
```
